-	Small Office Home Office (SOHO) is a small network (Connection) of Computers with fill up a small house hold and or a small business.

# Exploring Connection Types and Features (Heading A)
When it comes to connecting computers, there are two common methods of doing this, via wired and or wireless. Although both methods have many other benefits two in particular do stand out. For a wired connection speed and interference reduction stands out. For wireless, portability and ease of access stands out.

## Choosing External Network Connections (Topic A)
-	Internet Service Provider (ISP) is the service company that allows users to connect to the internet. The internet is the most common type of external connection.
-	Dial -Up/POTS Plain Old Telephone Service requires a telephone to connect to a modem to connect to the internet.
- The benefits of using dial up were: Cost (Its super cheap), Easy to set up and configure because all you need is a telephone line.
-	The only drawback is that, it was super slow and you could not connect more than one computer to it because it would slow down every other computer connected to it, in that network.
-	DSL Digital Subscriber Line, just like Dial-Up also uses phone lines to connect to the internet.
- It is faster than dial up. With this form of internet, you do not share your bandwidth with other users and it is generally more reliable than your other ISPs.
- The downside is that this service is not readily available, it cost more per house hold for lower speeds, and it requires more hardware components to configure i.e. networking cards, network cables, DSL modem, phone cord and line filters for each phone in the home.
-	Cable uses a coaxial cable to connect to the modem than a telephone line. It is very difficult to distinguish data transfer speeds because there are many factors that come into consideration and they vary.
-	Cable’s Pros are: Its much faster than dial-up and it much faster than DSL (particularly during uploading), no telephone line needed and it is very reliable.
-	Cables Cons are: It requires more hardware to set-up such as Network card, a network cable and a cable modem (which you are charged monthly to lease the modem), your band width is shared with others in your neighborhood and the cost is higher with Lower speeds starting around 20-30 dollars per month and the advertised running at $100 or more.  
-	Fiber-Optic Internet is very impressive when it comes to its speeds and the amount of bandwidth that it delivers.
-	The Benefits of Fiber Optic are incredible speeds and bandwidth.
-	The Cons with Fiber Optics is cost and availability meaning, it simply cost too much all around, the cables, the installation and operation all cost a lot, in addition its availability is very limited to the amount of people that can connect to it. It is more expensive than cable.
-	Satellite use satellite dish to connect to the internet, by receiving data from an orbiting satellite and relay station that is connected to the internet.
-	Satellite connections are much slower than broadband connections and is not a reliable, due to interference due to weather and satellite alignment.
-	Connection delay or Latency meaning the amount of time it takes for the data to be transmitted and received via the satellite.
-	The advantages of using satellite would be to not have to use cables or any wires to configure and set up especially when a user is in location that is not near place that is difficult to run wires around.
-	Point-to-multipoint is the second reason to why Satellite is so good, meaning it transmits on signal to a number of receivers simultaneously, which is why it is used for other applications such as: i.e. GPS, to broadcast television and radio signals.
-	Cellular (Cellular Networking) is what allowed us to be able to connect to the internet, which was once something that was only afforded to only computers.
-	Cellular Technical Specifications has major standards that are used around the world, which include the Global System for Mobile Communications (GMS) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).
-	GMS: is the most popular, boasting more than 1.5 billion users in 210 countries.
-	CDMA: is the only cellular standard that is currently used in the United States.
Both standards are not compatible with each other, meaning if you had GMS standard you cannot change standards to the CMDA.
-	Mobile Hotspots are devices or network cards that are designed to allow computers and other non-cellular cards to access the internet through cellular transmissions.
-	Radio Frequency Internet (noncellular-wireless) is a broadband Internet access, that is least popular connection. A service provider uses a transmitter to broadcast a signal and a customer would have a radio receiver at the other end to pick up the signal. The receiver is then connected to a router or computer in a similar fashion as cable or DSL. It cost more than a wired connection for speeds similar to a wired connection.

## Choosing Internal Network Connections (Topic B)
-	Wired Network Connections form the backbone of nearly every network. Wired networks are faster and more secure than their wireless counterparts. There are two choices of connection types when it comes to wired connections: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and Fiber-optic.
-	Unshielded twisted pair (UTP): is a copper wired cable that transmits electrical pulses. It is mildly secure and susceptible to interception (wiretapping) and electromagnetic interference. Although it cost less that its Fiber optic counterpart.
-	Fiber-Optic: is a wire made of glass or plastic and transmits signals using light. Is extremely secure resistant towards wiretapping and electromagnetic interference. It is more expensive than its Copper wired counterpart to set-up and can cover long distances.
Both forms of wired connections require than the user also purchase the equipment that goes along with the wire i.e. the correct network cards, cables, location in which to connect the devices, etc. When configuring a wired network, you want to think about the speed, distance and cost.

-	Wireless Network Connections are convenient, which is the number one reason to why people prefer them over all other types of connections, however they a bit more expensive than their wired copper counterparts. In general, wireless connections typically/ if not always face the same security flaws which are mechanical and environmental interference.
-	Wireless LAN (WLAN) has only one option available today, which is IEEE 802.11 standard. When determining this connection, you must consider, speed, security, distance and cost. It is best to start with the most robust wireless technology because it is backward compatible with the previous versions of 802.11a/b/g.
-	Bluetooth is designed for a Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN), meaning it is not the right technology to use for your home office or Small business. It is perfect for connecting devices such as smartwatches, mice, keyboards, headsets and printers (In close proximity). Bluetooth devices can connect up-to several other devices in one piconet.
-	WPAN Wireless Personal Area Network is a small and network that connects smaller mobile smart devices, at a close proximity.
-	Piconet is an ad hoc network, meaning that two Bluetooth devices are connected by getting close enough to each other.
-	Infrared is a connection created through waves, these waves are longer than light and shorter than microwaves. The communication approach model used by this technology is a walk-up and point-to-point. Although atmospheric conditions may disrupt infrared waves, there are no concerns of interference or signal conflicts and security is not much of an infrared issue since the maximum range in order to communicate is roughly 1 meter.
-	Walk-up and Point-to-point meaning you need to be very close and be in the line of sight with the device you want to communicate with. i.e. Remote controls.

# Understanding Network Connectivity Essentials
There are two components to understanding network connectivity, the first is hardware, which is the hardware used to connect computing devices to the network and the second is using protocol, which is the language that computer use to communicate with each other on a network. Another thing to also consider would be methods of storing data through the network.
## Common Networking Devices
-	Modem are used to connect to a network via, telephone lines, by converting digital signals from a computer into analog signals that can be transmitted over phone lines and back again.
-	Switch are central to most networks; they examine the header of incoming data packets and forward it properly to the right port and only to that port by using the MAC address of the device. They typically use lights to indicate good (flickering green) and bad connections (amber).
-	Access Point aka Wireless Access Point (WAP), is any point that allows a user to get on a network. This device allows users to connect to the network wirelessly.
-	Router is a highly intelligent network connectivity device that can connect multiple network types to each other. Connecting devices through their logical IP addresses. Also, more devices can be connected through routers than switches and they could be wired or wireless.
-	Firewalls are the gatekeepers that protect your network from hackers and malware.
-	Firewalls filter network traffic filter incoming and outgoing traffic of your network, determined by your system Administrator.
-	Access Control List are the list of rules or conditions on what traffic comes into a network and what goes out.
-	Firewalls can be software-base, hardware-based or a combination of both
-	There are two type of firewalls: network-based and host-based
-	Network-based: Protects computers and almost always is a hardware solution with software on it.
-	Host-based: protects only one computer and are almost always software solutions.
-	Network-based firewalls separate pubic vs. Private networks and can also create a DMZ
-	Demilitarized Zone: is a space between two firewalls, or the port used to connect servers that can be considered both public and private i.e. web and email servers.

## Networking Protocols Basics
Networking protocols are a lot like human languages in that they are the languages that 		computers speak when talking to each other. Although there are many different protocols, the
most popular protocol has been TCP/IP because it is the protocol that was used for the internet.
- Protocol is a set of rules that govern communications.

## TCP/IP Essentials
Computers must follow rules for them to communicate effectively. The Department of Defense 		created the DoD Model which has 4 layers that specify the tasks that need to happen: Process/ 		Application, Host-to-Host, Internet, and Network Access.
-	Understanding IP Addressing helps understand how our devices communicate and identify each other on the network.
-	IP Address is a 32-Bit hierarchical address that identifies a HOST (device) on a network. i.e. 192.168.10.55
-	Host is any device that is assigned an IP address to it.
-	Network ID: Are the set of numbers that Identify the network that devices connect to.
-	Host ID: Are the set of numbers that identify the device within the network.
-	Subnet Mask: Is how computers tell the different between the Network ID and HOST ID.
-	Default Gateway: It the ability of the router to stand as the door between the internal network and the outside world.
-	DHCP and DNS stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS).
-	DHCP: Can be configured to provide (assign) IP configuration information automatically to clients (HOST) or have the Administrator configure this themselves by assigning a Static IP Address.
-	DNS: Assigns an IP address to a domain name, making it easy for the navigator to simply enter address text rather than memorizing the IP address. i.e. converting www.google.com to 72.14.205.104.
-	Static IP Addressing is the process in which the system Administrator assigns IP addresses manually to each HOST.
-	Uniform Resource Locator a location or address identifying where documents can be found on the internet.
-	Automatic Private IP Addressing is a computer that automatically assigns itself an IP address and cannot connect to the Internet.
-	Public vs. Private IP Address
-	Public IP: Connects to the Internet and Routable.
-	Private IP: Local IP, doesn’t connect to the Internet and is nonroutable.
-	Network Address Translation (NAT): is the system that uses the router’s IP address as Public to send and receive data to and from the Internet, while your HOST device is given a Private IP address for your Internal network.

## Network Storage Options
There are many different types of networks to storage options to connect to, examples	include file servers, NAS and Cloud Storage.
-	Local Network Storage are made of two types File serve and Network-Attached Storage.
-	File Server is a computer that is specialized to store user files.
-	Network-Attached Storage is storage device that is attached to the network interface card.
-	Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is a configuration that is used for network-based storage devices, which provides fault-tolerance services.
-	Cloud Storage Services is much easier to work with than the other network-based storage types, those include; you don’t need to buy hardware and it is easy to configure or install.

# Setting Up a Wireless Network
It can be daunting when configuring a wireless Network, but it has become relatively easy of a task to configure and create connection. Most routers bought today come with wireless capability and have a four wire ports available not only for wired connectivity, but to also configure the router itself. Wireless router manufactures use different software, but you can usually configure their parameters with the built-in, web-based configuration utility that’s included with the product.

## Basic Configuration
The Wi-Fi Alliance is the authorized expert in the field of wireless LANs.
-	Step 1: Accept the License Agreement is the process in which you complete the EUSA and register your router when installing the drivers or the software that the router comes with before initiating router configuration.
-	Step 2: Connect the Router which would check see or verify if the router is capable to connect to the outside world. If there is an error message make sure that the router is powered and all basic troubleshooting steps have been taken e.g. router is connected to the ISP port on your house hold wall.
-	Step 3: Finish Basic Configuration will have the software determine if your router is working and if the default configurations are all set. During this process, you will also configure the what security parameters that you want to incorporate on your router.
-	Step 4: Secure the Network by changing the SSID from default, set security Protocol (WEP, WPA and WPA2) and finally Apply a new wireless password.
-	Service Set Identifier (SSID) is a unique name that is given to the wireless network, which the user can rename to identify their network.
-	Passphrase is the part were the user will issue a pass word for the network, which other users will use to connect to that network.
-	Step 5: Change the Administrator password and Update Firmware is important and should be done before exiting the configuration.  The admin password should not be the same as the wireless passphrase, this reduces security vulnerabilities within the system. Unless necessary, firmware should be updated only if the device is not working properly.
-	Step 6: Connect to the Network and Verify Internet Connectivity is done by checking if the wireless signal is being transmitted by the router through the devices network settings. [It’s important to note that mobile devices have the capabilities to connect to your router, meaning they should have a wireless receiver to pick up the signal.]

## Wireless Router Security
-	Open Portals provide potential users, access to a network without the need to enter a password. This may not be as secure because it may allow any wireless users to be able to connect to the network.
-	Captive portal is a type of open portal in which the user connecting to that network, is taken to a welcome page notifying the user of the conditions of the networks including which behaviors are permitted.
-	WEP Wired Equivalency Protocol, provided data transmission security, by providing the client a static key (Password) in order to communicate with a WEP-enabled device. WEP is vulnerable because of the nature of the static keys and weaknesses in the encryption algorithms.
-	WPA Wi-Fi Protected Access is an improvement over WEP, it followed the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol which used 128-bit and each packet is Dynamically allocated this type of key.
-	Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) is an encryption protocol included as part of the IEEE 802.11i standard for wireless LANs (WLANs). This standard that was capable of allocating 128-bit Keys dynamically to each packet that being transmitted through wireless LAN.
-	WPA2 Wi-Fi Protected Access 2, made huge improvements over the WEP and WPA by implementing the Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP), which is a protocol based on the Advance Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.
-	Advance Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher chosen by the U.S Government to protect classified information and is implemented in software and hardware throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data.

## Additional Wireless Router Services
-	Guest Access is for clients who need Internet access but aren’t allowed to see the rest of the network. Guest clients will need to know the SSID of the guest network and the password.
-	DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol automatically configures clients with IP addresses, this can be enabled by your router’s configuration options.
-	NAT Network Address Translation, allows you to use a private IP address internally but still get to the Internet. Basically it helps translate traffic coming from the internet identify the a local area network by assigning an Internet based IP to a internal LAN IP.
-	QoS Quality of Service is a strategy that allows an administrator to control resources, by setting different priorities for one or more types of network traffic based on different applications, data flows or users, this is typically meant for WANs not really for SOHO LANs.
-	Firewall are the software based security rules that can be configured to set internet access policy and blocking protocols such as HTTP, FTP, etc., along with Limiting internet access times and implementing parental controls.

# Summary
In summary we discussed the hardware tools that are required to establish a connection and how to secure that network. Depending on the network choice, that will determine how secure your network would be and what would be required by other devices to connect to that network.
