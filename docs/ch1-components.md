# Introducing Internal Components
Computer components are mostly Modular meaning they can be removed and replaced by another piece of hardware that does the same thing, provided that it’s compatible and it fits. For example, if the hard drive in your laptop fails, it can be removed and replaced by another hard drive.

Field Replaceable Units are used to describe modular components that can be replaced.

Cases serves two primary functions:
-	Keeping all the components securely in place.
-	Protecting the components from harm.

# Exploring Motherboards, Processors and Memory
Motherboards, processors and memory are the holy of the computer.

## Motherboards

Motherboard: Connects all the other components of a computer together. It acts like the nervous system of the computer. It is also known as a ‘system board or mainboard’.
Below is a list of some of the Features and Components that are associated with a mother board:
-	Form Factors- The physical size and shape of a motherboard.
-	Chipsets- A collection of integrated circuits that perform functions for the processor. They dictate how a motherboard will communicate with the installed peripherals.
-	Processor sockets- A socket in which a processor or CPU is placed into. Although CPU come varied, their sockets either come in two different types: Land Grid Array (LGA) or Pin Grid Array (PGA).
-	LGA – Meaning the socket has a flat surface, which allow a CPU with a flat or smooth surface to make contact with the Processor Socket.
-	PGA – Meaning the socket has, tiny holes on its surface, which allow a CPU with tiny needle pins to make contact with the Processor Socket.
-	Memory slots- Slots that are for modules that hold Random Access Memory (RAM) chips. They could be either DIMM (Desktop RAM size) or SODIMM (Laptop RAM size).
-	Expansion slots- Slots that are used to install various devices in the computer to expand its capabilities. These slots come in different versions; Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) and/or Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe).
-	Disk controllers- These are locations in which Hard Drive connectors connect to the motherboard. There are 3 main types of controller’s slots: Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE older slot), Parallel ATA (PATA) and/or Serial ATA (SATA).
o	Power controllers- Are special connectors’ which allows the motherboard to be connected to the power supply. Current Motherboards Come with the 24-pin connector, while older motherboards use 20-pin model.
-	BIOS/Firmware- Software that is encoded on a read only memory. Example of this would be the BIOS: Basic Input/ Output System which would be burned into a flash memory chip located on the motherboard.
-	CMOS and CMOS battery- Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor CMOS is a special memory chip which BIOS settings are stored ie: Date, Time, Hard Drive Configuration, RAM and CPU settings.

-	CMOS battery allows the CMOS chip to remain powered to allows changes made to the settings have been stored. If the battery loses power the chip will reset all of its configurations and not save any other changes made.
-	Back-panel connectors- All the different types of connectors that are located at the back of the computer.
-	Front-Panel connectors- Typically the Power and Reset Button are located, Drive Activity Lights, in addition to Audio Ports and other Connectors.

## Processors

-	Central Processing Unit (CPU): Is the brain of the computer, its main job is to control and direct all the activities of the computer. The CPU is the only computer component know to generate the most heat. 2 Of the largest CPU manufactures are Intel and Advance Micro Devices (AMD).

-	CPU: are built in 3 architecture types; 32-bit, 64 bit and ARM.
-	32-bit cannot process as much data as a 64-bit architecture.
-	Advance RISC Machines (ARM) refers to processors that uses an architecture known as Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) which means these chips take a longer method to compute calculations than a normal chip. However, the benefits of being slower than a regular PC or Laptop chip is that it can be built much smaller and also produce less heat.

-	CPU speed: Is measured in electrical cycles per second called HERTZ. Modern CPU process electrical cycles in billions of Cycles per second (Gigahertz per second). That is why when you look up CPU speeds they are always written in GHz.

-	CPU: have built in memory called cache, which typically come with 3 Levels in one chip. L1, L2 and L3.
  -	L1 is most commonly known as the fastest, but the smallest capacity.
  -	L2 is slower in speed that L1 but larger in capacity.
  -	L3 is the slowest in speed but, much larger in capacity than L1 and L2 combined.

## Memory
Memory is a computer hardware device that is used to store data.
Data/Memory can be stored on this hardware device in one of two ways: statically or dynamically.
-	Static Memory means the data stored does not need power to keep the data saved within it, known as nonvolatile memory.
-	Dynamic Memory meaning the data stored requires a constant flow of power (electricity) to keep the data, known as volatile memory.

Memory is designed, to be accessed in one of 2 ways: Read Only Memory (ROM) and Random Accessed Memory (RAM).
-	ROM is data stored permanently on the hardware or chip, in which you cannot make changes to its content at all.
-	RAM is which can be written and rewritten on the hardware or chip. There are two common forms of RAM, Static RAM (SRAM) and Dynamic RAM (DRAM).
-	SRAM is does not need power to keep its data. Writing or storing files on SRAM is called Flashing. This is why SRAM is also referred to as Flash RAM.
-	DRAM does require power to keep its data.
-	Memory Bus: is the pathway which data is delivered to and from memory. Memory on modern PC is synchronized with the system bus, which is controlled by a system timer (known as Northbridge) on the mother board. The system timer controls how fast the data enters the processor (CPU).
-	Memory that is designed to operate at the same speed as the Memory Bus or Front side-bus it is called single data rate (SDR) Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (SDRAM).
-	Successor to SDRSDRAM is called Double Data Rate (DDR) SDRAM also called DDR1. There are other successors to DDR1 such as DDR2, DDR3, DDR4 etc. With each successor the speed doubles from the previous version.

Memory today is arranged on a small circuit board. i.e. Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM). DIMM is arranged is such a way that the pins that connect to the RAM socket on the motherboard are placed on both sides of the RAM chip.
-	Laptops use Small Outline Dual Inline Memory (SODIMM) which is smaller compared to the DIMM model.

# Exploring Storage and Expansion Devices
Storage devices prolong the long-term storage, while Expansion Devices expand your systems’ functionality by giving it additional features.  

## Hard Drives
Hard drives are used for permanent storage and quick access.
-	Hard drives come in 2 sizes 3.5 and 2.5 inches, they can come either as a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or Solid-State Drive (SDD). The storage capacity of a hard drive is measure in bytes i.e. A drive would have 100GB meaning it would have 1 Trillion bytes stored within it.
-	HDD drives have moving parts within them and have their speed measured in Revolutions Per Minute (RPM). This is due to the fact they have moving parts within them. Due to the improvement towards the technology of HDD this has resulted them in becoming more affordable.
-	SSD drives have no moving parts within which makes them faster (Read and Write times), consume less power and more resilient than their HDD counterpart. However, they are more expensive than their HDD and have a finite (limited) amount of write operations.
-	Connecting a Hard drive to the motherboard of either a Desktop or Laptop depends on the standard that the drive uses. There are 2 common hard drive standards that are used in the market today. Parallel ATA (PATA) also know as Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) and Serial ATA (SATA).  
-	PATA has been around longer.
-	SATA is the newer and faster technology.

## Optical Drives
An optical drive is a computer hardware that, uses laser light as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical disks, i.e. Compact Disks (CD), Digital Video Disk (DVD), Blue ray Disk (BD), etc.
-	Each type of Optical Disk comes with its own unique features such as, being re-writable for writability, Dual layer for writable layers and Double Side for the amount of sides in which data can be written or read from.

## Video Cards
A video card also known as Graphics adapter is an expansion card that is put into your		 computer to display output on your monitor.
-	Video cards come equipped with their own unique graphics adapter i.e. VGA, DVI or HDMI. In addition, video cards have additional features such as their own processor called Graphics Procession Unit (GPU) which is dedicated for graphics computation, and also their own RAM embedded on the card.

## Sound Cards
Sounds cards are converting computer signals into sound. They typically come with 3.5 mm jacks which allows sound devices to connect to then i.e. Headphones, speakers etc.
-	Old models of sound cars used to also come with a DA15 game port, to allow joysticks (gaming controllers) to be connected to the card.

## Network Cards
Network Cards allow computers to communicate and share data with other computers, via either a wired or wireless connection.

## Modems
Modems (Modulator/ Demodulator) is a device that converts digital signals to analog signals that can be transmitted over phone lines and back again. These devices allow things such as Faxing through the computer to be possible.

# Exploring Power and Cooling
Computers require power to function, however they also generate a lot of heat in the process, which results in the need for a cooling.

## Power Supplies
The device that power a computer is called a Power Supply Unit (PSU). PSU convert AC current to DC current to power the components of the motherboard. PSU unit of power is rated in watts. The higher the rating the more the PSU produces the power.

## Cooling Systems
Providing power to computer components generates a lot of heat, which in turn shortens the life of the computer. To prevent premature decay of computer components two cooling systems are put in place: Case (Chassis) and /or CPU cooling.
-	Case (Chassis) cooling most commonly uses fans to cool components of a computer. The placement of the fans is what is what decides how the PC cools itself, i.e. Front Intake Fan - Takes in fresh cool air into the chassis.
-	Rear Exhaust Fan - Takes out all the hot air generated in the chassis.
-	Power Supply Exhaust Fan – Takes out heat generated by the PSU.  
-	CPU cooling could use Air or Liquid cooling systems to keep the CPU from overheating. 	
-	CPU Air cooling blows air down the heatsink (A device used to transfer heat generated by the CPU out) to join the current air being exhausted by the Exhaust fan.
-	CPU Liquid cooling uses special water block to conduct heat away from the CPU and circulate it through the block to a radiator, where it is cooled. Although liquid cooling is quieter than air cooling, it is more expensive and are perceived to cause more damage to a computer if the device breaks within the chassis.

# Summary
In this chapter we looked at many things:
-	First, we looked at motherboards, CPU and Memory. The motherboard is considered the computers central nervous system that connects all the component of a computer, while The CPU server’s as the brains of the computer and the memory stores data and instructions.
-	Second, we looked at various storage devices and expansion devices. We learned that Hard drives allow long term storage of data and expansion devices add more functionality to a computer device i.e. video cards, sound cards, network cards, etc.
-	Finally, Power supply which keep computer components powered and System cooling which provide the cooling of the components within the computer chassis (case). In addition, we also learned that there are two methods used to keep the CPU cool; air and liquid which uses water.
